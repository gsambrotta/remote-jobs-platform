# üåç Pakufi Global Jobs Platform

This project is a simple job board that helps people from underrepresented regions (e.g., Africa, the Balkans, Asia, Latin America) find **100% remote jobs** that **do not require a work visa for Europe, USA, Switzerland, or other wealthy Western countries**.  

You can visit the platform here: https://remote-jobs-platform-frontend.onrender.com

## Project Structure

The repository contains **two separate applications**:

1. **Frontend** (`/frontend`)  
   * Built with **React + Vite + Tailwind**  
   * Displays the job listings, filters, and UI  
   * Fetches job data from the backend API  

   See [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) for setup instructions  

2. **Backend** (`/backend`)  
   * Built with **Flask**  
   * Connects to a **Supabase (PostgreSQL) database**  
   * Exposes REST API endpoints to serve job data  
   * Contains scripts to fetch and structure job postings  

   See [Backend README](./backend/README.md) for setup instructions  

Both the frontend and backend are **separate apps**.  
They require separate installation, setup, and running processes.
